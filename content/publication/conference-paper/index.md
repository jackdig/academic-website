abstract: Palermo is a populous city situated on the northern coast of Sicily,
  bordered by the Tyrrhenian Sea. This central part of the Mediterranean Sea
  features dramatic bathymetry, numerous subaqueous landslides and is also the
  epicentre to many subaqueous earthquakes. As such, the region is an area prone
  to tsunamis. This investigation uses the Cornell Multi-Grid Coupled Tsunami
  (COMCOT) tsunami modelling package to simulate five near-field landslides, and
  five near-field earthquakes regarded as worst-case credible scenarios for
  Palermo. The seismic simulations produced waves on a very small scale, the
  largest being c. 5 cm at its maximum height, and none of the
  earthquake-generated tsunami waves produced any measurable inundation. The
  landslide simulations produced larger waves ranging from 1.9 to 12 m in
  maximum height, two of which resulted in inundation in areas surrounding the
  Port of Palermo. Sensitivity analysis identified that fault width and
  dislocation as well as landslide-specific gravity did have significant
  influence over maximum wave height, inundation and maximum run-up wave height.
  There are methodological issues limiting the extent to which this study forms
  a comprehensive tsunami hazard assessment of Palermo, such as gaps in
  bathymetric data, computational restrictions and lack of a probabilistic
  element. These issues are counteracted by the fact that this study does serve
  as a robust first step in identifying that landslides in the region may
  produce larger tsunami waves than earthquakes, and that the directionality of
  mass movement is critical in landslide-driven tsunami propagation in the
  southern Tyrrhenian region.
