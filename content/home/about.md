Jack Dignan is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Statistical Science at University College London, UK, supervised by Prof Serge Guillas. His research looks at the use of state-of-the-art 3D modelling to improve the modelling of tsunami inundation and interaction with coastal structures, particularly focusing on the potential of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for this purpose. He completed a BSc in Geography at the University of Southampton (2018), and an MSc in Geological and Environmental Hazards between the University of Portsmouth and the University of Malta (2019). Prior to starting his PhD, Jack spent a year working at eCoast, a marine consultancy in New Zealand, contributing to various projects such as tsunami evacuation zone delineation and inundation mapping.
